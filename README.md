# ADS-301-Final-Project
The goal of this project was to build several models of increasing complexity to measure whether suicide rates are consistent across race groups or geographic locations in the U.S.



There are four files in this respository. The first two are CSV's which contain the data for the presentation. The third is a preprocessing document, and the final one is where the processing and creation of the models is located.
